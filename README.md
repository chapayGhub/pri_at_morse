# PRI @ morse
> **Privacy @ morse** using @sign P2P encryption

This project is created keeping privacy at the top of the head. What it looks from outside is just a chatting chatting. But it is built with privacy at it's core.

* P2P encryption (using **@sign**)
* Morse translation (uses **custom morse code standard**, on top of the INTERNATIONAL MORSE STD.)
